    <!-- To add a built-in View to your user interface, you specify it in an XML element and
    control its appearance and behavior with element attributes. Well-written custom
    views can also be added and styled via XML. To enable this behavior in your
    custom view, you must:

Define custom attributes for your view in a <declare-styleable> resource element
Specify values for the attributes in your XML layout
Retrieve attribute values at runtime
Apply the retrieved attribute values to your view
-->
    <declare-styleable name="LocationEditTextPreference">
        <attr name="minLength" format="integer" />
